# Characters Fight!

## Description
This program simulates a Super Hero character fight.
The fight starts with the first hero of Team 1, then continue the turn of the first hero of Team 2, and so on.
The current hero fights with a random opponent, using stats (mental, strong fast) also randomly.
Every hero has a 0.1 of probability to fail and damage her/himself.
When all heroes of a team are with 0 hp, then the other team win the fight.

## How to run the code
To run this program, use:
```
ruby ./main.rb
```

## Console Display Modes

If you want to see the battle with attention, you can use the flag `--slow` when you run the code, like this:
```
ruby ./main.rb --slow
```
But, if you prefer to see the results "to the shot", there's no need.
